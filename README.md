# Clock

[https://timendus.github.io/clock/](https://timendus.github.io/clock/)

This clock is designed to help give your days some more structure, without being
distracting.

Enter your day's rough schedule and it will remind you when you go from one
block to the next. Make sure you pick some colours that you enjoy seeing :)

Note that it's not an agenda. It's a structure-keeper.

## Local development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Timendus/clock.git
cd clock
npm install
npm start
```
